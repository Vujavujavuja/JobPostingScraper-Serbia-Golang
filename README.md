## Job Postings aggregator for the Serbian IT market
This is a simple web scraper that scrapes job postings from popular Serbian IT boards like Infostud, HelloWorld.rs and many more.
After Scraping the job postings it will display them in a simple GUI where you can filter them by keywords, companies, locations and more.
